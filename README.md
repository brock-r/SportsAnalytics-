## Sports Statistic Project

### Goal 

The goal of this project is to provide exciting thought-provoking MMA sports statistics for fans around the world. Further strengthening the social media presence and general following of the sport.

### Data Wrangling Strategies and Manipulation

Web Scraping advanced sports statistics using Python's Beautiful Soup library, extracting data from a variety of different website links. Organizing data into Pandas dataset for data cleaning and sport-related feature additions. The [Athlete Profiles]( https://github.com/brock-r/SportsAnalytics-/blob/master/AndNewAnalytics/Athlete%20Profiles.ipynb) file contains summary statistics of all fighters throughout their careers. The [Fight Statistics](https://github.com/brock-r/SportsAnalytics-/blob/master/AndNewAnalytics/Fight%20Stats.ipynb) file contains fight data from every UFC event. The data is managed within a PostgreSQL database. Python scripts are automatically ran and implemented after each weekly event via Windows Task Scheduler. Lastly, using photo editing tools such as photoshop to create relevant social media posts that can be found, including animated graphs and much more [here]( https://www.instagram.com/andnewanalytics/). Check out the Python code for an [example week](https://github.com/brock-r/SportsAnalytics-/blob/master/AndNewAnalytics/Example%20Week.ipynb) of statistics.
